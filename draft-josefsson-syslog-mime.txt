                 The text/syslog Media Type for Syslog
                     draft-josefsson-syslog-mime-00

Abstract

   The syslog protocol is used to convey event notification messages
   across the network.  This document specify a stored format for Syslog
   information.

1.  Introduction and Background

   The syslog [RFC5424] protocol specify the wire format of standardized
   syslog, but it does not specify a format for stored data.  This
   document describe how syslog messages are stored in text files in a
   format that is close to the on-the-wire format.

   There are two main issues that this document addresses: the important
   information on syslog priority and facility is usually discarded in
   existing implementations and there are no common rules for control
   character escaping provided.  This document offers guidelines for
   both.

   The encoding outlined in this document can be used both with legacy
   syslog as described in [RFC3164] and standardized [RFC5424] syslog.

2.  Syslog Format

   The textual representation is on-the-wire format as documented in
   [RFC5424] except for the control character handling describe below.
   The PRI field MUST be included inside the textual representation, as
   discussed in [RFC5424].  The ABNF rule for on-the-wire syslog
   messages is SYSLOG-MSG.

   Each syslog message MUST be delimited by a CRLF trailer.

   Control characters inside the textual representation MUST be escaped.
   Characters %x00 to %x1F and %x7f MUST be encoded as "#ooo" where
   "ooo" is the threee-digit octal representation of the characters'
   numerical code.  The character "#" (%x23) MUST be encoded as "##".
   Please note that this encoding is consistent with what many
   implementations already use.  We have selected this encoding in the
   hope that it be the least intrusive one.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The registration template as documented in [RFC4288] follows:

   Type name: text

   Subtype name: syslog

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: The "charset" parameter MAY be used as discussed
   in [RFC4288], and is normally UTF-8.

   Encoding considerations: 8bit, to preserve UTF-8 data.

   Security considerations: Syslog information may be security relevant,
   and could warrant integrity and even confidentiality protection.
   Solutions to this problem is outside the scope of this document, but
   we note the existence of PGP/MIME [RFC3156] and S/MIME [RFC5751].

   Interoperability considerations:

   Published specification: This document and [RFC5424].
